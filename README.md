# Lab Training Syllabus

## Week 1 - Web programming & jsPsych

This week will cover the basics of building an experiment for the web. We will go over key components of an online experiment, jsPsych objects, and writing jsPsych plugins. We will also cover how Python can be used to generate trials for a more complex experiment.

##### Topics:

* Web programming best practice & experimental structure
* Writing a (useful) JSON file
* jsPsych
	* The timeline
	* What is a trial?
	* Plugins
* Python
	* Generating balanced trials

_*HW 1.1*_: Develop an image-rating experiment using jsPsych

_*HW 1.2*_: Write a python script that generates factors for a set of manipulations and outputs trials in CSV format

## Week 2 - Supporting technologies

This week will cover use of Firebase and Mechanical Turk to run experiments and store data.

##### Topics:

* Firebase
	* Command-line installation and usage
	* Adding Firebase to a web project
	* The Firebase console
		* Storage
		* The database
* Mechanical Turk
	* What is a HIT?
	* Creating a good ad page
	* Approving completed HITs
	* Using the Mechanical Turk sandbox
* Python (part 2)
	* Cleaning data

_*HW 2.1*_: Integrate _HW 1.1_ with Firebase and Mechanical Turk

_*HW 2.2*_: Use the Mechanical Turk Sandbox to test your trials from _HW 1.2_

_*HW 2.3*_: Write a Python script to clean the resulting data

## Week 3 - Lab equipment and procedures

In the last session we will cover in-lab methods of data collection, with a focus on two different software (PsychoPy and E-Prime).

##### Topics:

* PsychoPy
	* Routines and Loops
	* Components
	* The PsychoPy Coder
* E-Prime
	* Objects
	* Procedures
	* Coding in E-Basic
	 
*_HW 3.1_*: Develop an image-rating experiment in PsychoPy

*_HW 3.2_*: Try out E-Prime
